# 4-Channel RF Front End

An open-source (KiCAD) RF front end with 4 independent RX &amp; TX channels optimized for MIMO/Radar prototyping. It implements an I2C bus for digital control of each channelâ€™s attenuation and single-ended control of T/R switch for fast action. A switch-mode power supply and separate low dropout regulators for each channel are utilized to provide low-ripple power to RF Low Noise Amplifiers.
